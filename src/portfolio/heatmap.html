                  It was July 2024 when I was onboarded with the challenge of reimagining the interface for Heatmap during my internship at Full Sprint. Heatmap (Heatmap.com) is an innovative analytics platform that helps small businesses gain insights into user interactions on their websites. By visualizing the most clicked areas (heatmaps), providing screen recordings, and offering AI-driven insights, Heatmap empowers business owners to make data-driven decisions for their online storefronts. With new features constantly being added, the existing interface became increasingly fragmented and difficult to navigate. This case study details the redesign process aimed at creating a cohesive, scalable experience that aligns with Heatmap’s updated design language and expanded feature set.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Imagine walking into a house where new furniture had been added whenever needed, without consideration for the overall layout or style. A modern sectional sofa sits next to a vintage rocking chair, while a minimalist coffee table clashes with an ornate cabinet. That's what Heatmap's interface had become – a collection of mismatched features that, while individually functional, created a confusing and disjointed experience. The result:
                </p>

                <ul class="pr-maxwidth paragraph-list">
                  <li><u>Inconsistent navigation:</u> The UI lacked a clear hierarchy or logical grouping of features.</li>
                  <li><u>Fragmented design:</u> The old interface felt incoherent as new modules were added arbitrarily.</li>
                  <li><u>Increased cognitive load:</u> Users struggled to find and learn new features in the disorganized layout.</li>
                  <li><u>Unscalable structure:</u> The existing framework could not smoothly accommodate expanding capabilities.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="pr-maxwidth">
                  <u>Goal:</u> Redesign the Heatmap portal so it presents a unified visual language, improves feature discoverability, and streamlines user workflows for analyzing data—all while remaining flexible for future updates.

                  Before jumping into solutions, I needed to understand what Heatmap was up against. I started by examining other analytics platforms, noting how they handled similar challenges. Key observations included:
                </p>

                <ul class="pr-maxwidth paragraph-list">
                  <li>Clear, Collapsible Navigation as a common strategy for handling multiple analytics features.</li>
                  <li>Split Views for showing data alongside a list for easy navigation.</li>
                  <li>Modular Dashboards that let users see at-a-glance metrics quickly and customize their data.</li>

                <p class="pr-maxwidth">
                  These insights guided the redesign’s approach to navigation, layout, and data presentation.

                  <br>
                  I conducted a deep dive into the existing platform to understand its structure and usability challenges. This involved systematically mapping out features, analyzing navigation flows, and identifying inconsistencies.

                <ul class="pr-maxwidth paragraph-list">
                  <li>Comprehensive Feature Audit: Mapped out every feature and its location in the portal.</li>
                  <li>Information Architecture Review: Assessed the hierarchical structure of pages and sections.</li>
                  <li>Navigation Pattern Analysis: Noted user pathways and identified bottlenecks.</li>
                  <li>Visual Consistency Check: Evaluated UI elements for brand alignment (where they existed).</li>
                </ul>

                  <span class="subhead pr-subhead">Key Findings</span>

                  <li>Navigation Bottlenecks: Switching between heatmap views or applying filters took multiple steps.</li>
                  <li>Limited Scalability: The existing structure was not well suited to handle a growing array of features.</li>

                  <br>
                  With a tight timeline ahead, I needed to move efficiently. Drawing inspiration from Heatmap's public preview page—which showcased their modern visual direction—I began sketching out solutions. Instead of getting caught in lengthy wireframing cycles, we made the bold decision to jump straight from low-fidelity sketches to high-fidelity designs.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <span class="subhead pr-subhead">3.1 Goals</span>
                </p>

                <ul class="pr-maxwidth paragraph-list">
                  <li>Establish a Cohesive Design System: Ensure visual and functional consistency across features.</li>
                  <li>Improve Navigation & Feature Discoverability: Simplify how users move between different toolsets (heatmaps, screen recordings, AI insights).</li>
                  <li>Streamline Workflow: Reduce unnecessary clicks, unify related features, and present data more clearly.</li>
                  <li>Maintain Familiarity: Provide a smooth transition for existing users so they can quickly adapt.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="pr-maxwidth">
                  <span class="subhead pr-subhead">3.2 Design Foundation</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  A pivotal reference point was an existing public preview page, approved by stakeholders, that showcased a modernized color palette and typography. By applying this established visual style consistently throughout the platform, the redesign aimed to unify existing features, accommodate new ones, and keep the interface intuitive.

                <ol class="pr-maxwidth paragraph-list">
                  <li>Low-Fidelity Wireframes: I started by sketching rough layouts for the navbar, dashboard, and key pages. This helped clarify the overall structure and key user flows.</li>
                  <li>Direct Jump to High-Fidelity: Due to a tighter timeline, we skipped the medium-fidelity stage. After reviewing the low-fidelity concepts with colleagues, I iterated directly in high-fidelity wireframes to refine visuals, layout, and components.</li>
                  <li>Advanced Figma Prototype: I built a fully interactive and size-responsive prototype in Figma, leveraging Auto Layout to ensure components and pages could scale or reflow easily. This prototype included:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Clickable navigation elements</li>
                      <li>Full-page transitions</li>
                      <li>Interactive filters and tabs for heatmaps and recordings</li>
                      <li>Responsive breakpoints to demonstrate adaptability</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Final Stakeholder Presentation: I presented the high-fidelity prototype to the Full Sprint and Heatmap team. Early feedback was generally positive, though Heatmap highlighted certain areas as needing additional refinement.</li>

                <p class="pr-maxwidth">
                  To illustrate how these design changes come together, meet Kaitlyn, a marketing specialist for a small organic skincare e-commerce store.

                <ul class="pr-maxwidth paragraph-list">
                  <li>Collapsible Navigation & Pinned Items
                    <ul>
                      <li>Use Case: Kaitlyn logs into the Heatmap portal to track performance after running a new campaign.</li>
                      <li>Before: She had to click through disjointed menus to get to her most-used heatmaps.</li>
                      <li>Now: She immediately notices the collapsible navigation on the left. It’s clearly labeled, paired with an icon, and streamlined. Below the tabs is the Pinned section, where she’s added her newly launched “Rose Glow Serum” heatmap. She clicks it to jump straight into analysis—no more hunting through multiple tabs.</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Use Case: Kaitlyn needs to identify user interaction hotspots for the new product page.</li>
                      <li>Before: Navigating to the heatmap was difficult in the cramped sidebar, data visibility controls were scattered.</li>
                      <li>Now: She clicks “Heatmaps” in the simplified nav, landing on a full-page list view of all her site’s heatmaps. She opens the “Rose Glow Serum” heatmap, and a clean data card pops up when she clicks on the hotspots, showing precise click counts and percentages. The separated controls at the top allow her to toggle device type or filter date ranges without losing her place. The new tabs to switch between heatmap, scrollmap, and data table means she know where to find the data she is looking for.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Screen Recordings Refresh
                    <ul>
                      <li>Use Case: Kaitlyn wants to watch real user sessions to see how visitors scroll and click around the product page.</li>
                      <li>Before: The session recordings panel was visually inconsistent, and recordings were hard to sift through.</li>
                      <li>Now: She heads over to Screen Recordings, where a dedicated list view with filtering lets her quickly find recordings tagged “Rose Glow Serum.” The enhanced viewer displays session duration, user device, and location information right alongside the playback. Kaitlyn notices several users never hover over the “Add to Cart” button—confirming the heatmap analysis and AI insights.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                </p>

                <p class="pr-maxwidth">
                  By guiding Kaitlyn through these key tasks, the redesigned portal addresses her specific pain points: scattered features, inconsistent UI patterns, and difficulty in quickly synthesizing user behavior data. Having everything organized under the new navigation system, with pinned items for rapid access, empowers Kaitlyn to make informed decisions about layout adjustments—ultimately enhancing the user experience on her e-commerce site.

                  This project taught me valuable lessons about balancing familiarity with innovation, designing for future growth, and working within time constraints. While I couldn't see the project through to implementation, I left knowing we had created a solid foundation for Heatmap's future growth.

                  By applying a new visual style and carefully reorganizing Heatmap’s navigation and data presentation, this redesign aims to streamline how users interact with heatmaps, screen recordings, and AI-driven insights. While fully implementing and testing these updates remains a future task, the positive initial response from Heatmap.com’s internal team and the constructive critiques offer a solid starting point for iterative improvement.
